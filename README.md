# Hungarian verbal complexes
## MA thesis

The thesis deals mainly with particle verbs. The most important research questions are as follows:
- What is the distribution of (detached) verbal particles compared to the finite verbs, and what can be the main factor determining the distance of the verbal particle?
- Can we find regular differences between the verbal particles, regarding to their positions in the sentence?
- What kind of words can stand between the verbal particle and the finite verb?
- What kind of verbs can have dozens of verbal particles, and what kind of verbs can have only one or two?
- What kind of verbs do usually have postverbal particles (e.g. *dolgoz fel* 'to process', *tevődik össze* 'to be composed of smth'), rather than preverbal ones?

Two types of bare nominals (which are verb modifiers just like the verbal particles) are briefly discussed in this work: (1) infinitives having inflection for person and (2) adjectives ending with dative case.

This list is based on the 2.0.3 version of the Hungarian Gigaword Corpus. It contains _verbal particle + verb_ combinations occurring at least 5 times in HGC (as types). The measurement includes only finite verbs and only with immediately preverbal particle. It is checked manually. Frequent, wrong combinations (e.g. *át+kell* 'to through+must') are filtered.
